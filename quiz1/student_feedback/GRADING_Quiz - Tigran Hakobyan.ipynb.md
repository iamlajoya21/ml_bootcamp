# Grading Report for Student Submission

## Question-by-Question Assessment

### Problem 1: The Secure Inventory Audit
*   **Grade:** 0/10
*   **Feedback:** No code was provided for this problem. To earn points, you would need to demonstrate file reading, error handling for non-integer quantities, string normalization (uppercasing), and data aggregation.

### Problem 2: The Login Security Monitor
*   **Grade:** 0/10
*   **Feedback:** No code was provided for this problem. A complete solution would involve filtering a list based on a set of blacklisted IPs, deduplicating the remaining IPs, storing them in a tuple, and writing them to a file.

### Problem 3: The "Strict" Transaction Processor
*   **Grade:** 0/10
*   **Feedback:** No code was provided for this problem. This problem required implementing a `while True` loop with a specific exit condition, comprehensive error handling using `try-except` blocks for `ValueError`, and custom `raise ValueError` statements for specific business logic, along with a `finally` block.

### Problem 4: The Global Gradebook Merger
*   **Grade:** 0/10
*   **Feedback:** No code was provided for this problem. To solve this, you would need to iterate through two dictionaries and merge their contents into a new dictionary, ensuring that lists of grades for common keys are extended, not overwritten.

## Overall Feedback
It appears that no code was submitted for any of the problems in this quiz. While this means no points could be awarded, it's important to understand that learning often involves attempting problems, even if the solution isn't perfect. I encourage you to review the problem descriptions and try to implement solutions for each. This practice is crucial for developing your programming skills and understanding the concepts covered. If you faced any technical issues during submission, please reach out to your instructor.
